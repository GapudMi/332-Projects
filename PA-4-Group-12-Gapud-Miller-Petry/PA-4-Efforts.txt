How to run the program?
Opening the PA-4-Executable.exe file will bring you to a repl page. To run the program, press the green run button or the white triangle.
Once the program runs, you will be prompted to type the step you want to climb to. Type only the stairstep you want to climb to then press enter. 
You will then be prompted to type the allowed step sizes. Type only the step sizes you want, separated by spaces then press enter.
The program will then show you the elapsed time of both recurisve and dynamic approaches as well as every valid path.
At any time you are prompted for input, you can type "exit" to close the program.
