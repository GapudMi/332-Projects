How to run the program?
Opening the PA-8-Executable.exe file will bring you to a Repl page. To run the program, press the green run button or the white triangle.
Once the program runs, you will be prompted for the number of nodes in the graph. Type your desired number, then press enter.
The program will show you all nodes and their names.
After that, you will be prompted to enter the number of edges of the first node. Type the number, then press enter.
You will then be prompted to specify which nodes are connected by those edges, one by one.
Type the name of the node connected by the edge, then press enter.
The program will then show you the current adjacency list for the graph to assist in understanding the developing graph.
Repeat that until all edges are accounted for.
This process repeats for each node in the array until each node has its edges specified.

Once all the nodes are specified, the program will conduct a depth-first search, starting from the first not node, and the table and queue corresponding to each step of the search will be printed.
