How to run the program?
After opening the exe, the user can type “recursive” or “dynamic” then press enter to make the algorithm use the respective method to calculate the fibonacci sequence. 
After that, the user can input the index of the fibonacci sequence they want to receive, where index 1 and index 2 are equal to 1. 
At this point, the Fibonacci_Time.csv file is saved into the directory that the program is contained within.
Then, the user is again prompted to type “recursive” or “dynamic” or to exit. When the user types “exit” the program will close.
After successfully closing using “exit,” the program will save the entries into the Fibonacci_Time.csv file. 
If the user does not use “exit” then the csv file will stay empty.
